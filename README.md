# TrailBlaze App

A cross-platform mobile app for horseback riders focusing on endurance and trail riding events.

## Overview
TrailBlaze is a cross-platform mobile app tailored for horseback riders on trails, focusing on distance-related sports such as endurance riding, CTR (Competitive Trail Ride), Ride and Tie, and general trail riding. The app helps riders easily find ride events, plan their trips, get answers to common questions, and connect with ride information, regardless of their location. Initially focused on the Pacific Northwest Endurance Rides (PNER) region, TrailBlaze aims to support riders across North America and beyond.

TrailBlaze will be free for users to download and use.

## Why TrailBlaze?
