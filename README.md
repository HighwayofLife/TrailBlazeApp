# TrailBlaze App

A cross-platform mobile app for horseback riders focusing on endurance and trail riding events.

## Overview
TrailBlaze is a cross-platform mobile app tailored for horseback riders on trails, focusing on distance-related sports such as endurance riding, CTR (Competitive Trail Ride), Ride and Tie, and general trail riding. The app helps riders easily find ride events, plan their trips, get answers to common questions, and connect with ride information, regardless of their location. Initially focused on the Pacific Northwest Endurance Rides (PNER) region, TrailBlaze aims to support riders across North America and beyond.

## Why TrailBlaze?
Endurance and trail riders often struggle with scattered event information and a lack of centralized planning tools. TrailBlaze solves these problems by bringing all relevant ride data together, ensuring riders can focus on their journey instead of logistics.

### Key Value Points:
- **Centralized Ride Calendar** – Easily browse and search for upcoming endurance rides, CTRs, Ride & Tie events, and trail rides.
- **Detailed Ride Information** – Access key details from ride flyers, including location, distances, requirements, and entry information.
- **Navigation & Trip Planning** – Utilize GPS-integrated navigation and written directions to ride camps.
- **AI-Powered Q&A** – Get instant answers to common ride-related questions using AI assistance.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility** – Available on iOS and Android devices.

## MVP Features (Initial Release - PNER Focus)
The first version of TrailBlaze is specifically tailored to the PNER (Pacific Northwest Endurance Rides) community, including riders in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and British Columbia. It focuses on core functionalities that provide immediate value:

- **Event Calendar** – Browse upcoming endurance rides and trail events with comprehensive details specific to the PNER region.
- **Event Details** – View essential ride information, including GPS and written directions, ride distances, specific requirements, and links to ride flyers.

## Future Plans & Enhancements
While the MVP focuses on the PNER region, TrailBlaze has ambitious plans to expand functionality and regional support over time:

- **Expanded Regional Support** – Grow beyond the Pacific Northwest into national and global endurance ride calendars, including AERC, CTR, Ride and Tie, FEI, AHA, and Canada Endurance events.
- **Community & Social Features** – Rider networking, event discussions, and mentorship connections.
- **GPS Ride Tracking Integration** – Connect with services like Ride with GPS for real-time ride tracking.

- **Personal Stats & Leaderboards** – Track completed rides, competition standings, and personal endurance milestones.
- **Push Notifications & Ride Reminders** – Stay updated with event changes, deadlines, and alerts.

## Monetization Strategy
TrailBlaze will be free for users to download and use. The primary monetization will be through sponsorships and advertising, ensuring a low barrier to entry and wide adoption within the community.

## Licensing
