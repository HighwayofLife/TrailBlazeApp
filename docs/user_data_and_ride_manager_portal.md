# User Data Collection, Permissions, and Ride Manager Portal

This document outlines the details of user sign-up, data collection, location permissions, notification settings, and the data-entry portal for ride/event managers.

## 1. User Sign-Up and Data Collection

### Sign-Up Process
The app will require users to sign up to access certain features, such as saving favorite events, creating a rider profile, and receiving personalized notifications. The sign-up process will involve collecting the following basic information:

*   **Name:** First and last name.
*   **Email:** For account verification and communication.
*   **Phone Number:** (Optional) For important notifications and updates.
*   **Location:** (Initial, Coarse Location) To provide location-relevant information.

### Data Storage
User data will be stored securely in the database (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB or MongoDB Atlas), adhering to privacy best practices. Data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

## 2. Location Permissions

### Permission Request
The app will request location permissions to provide location-relevant information, such as nearby events and trip planning. The permission request will be presented with a clear explanation of why the app needs location access and how it will be used.

*   **Initial Request:** The app will initially request coarse location permissions.
*   **Justification:** The justification will explain that location data is used to find nearby events and calculate travel distances.
*   **Optional Fine-Grained Location:** If the user wants more accurate location-based services (e.g., real-time ride tracking), the app will request fine-grained location permissions.

### Permission Settings
Users will be able to manage location permissions in the app settings. They can choose to grant or revoke location access at any time.

## 3. User Notification Settings

### Notification Types
The app will provide several types of notifications to keep users informed:

*   **Event Reminders:** Reminders for upcoming events that the user has saved or expressed interest in.
*   **Event Updates:** Notifications about changes to event details (e.g., cancellations, schedule changes, location updates).
*   **General Announcements:** Important announcements from PNER or other relevant organizations.

### Notification Preferences
Users will be able to customize their notification preferences in the app settings. They can choose which types of notifications they want to receive and how they want to receive them (e.g., push notifications, email).

## 4. Ride/Event Manager Data-Entry Portal

### Purpose
A dedicated data-entry portal or back-end service will be created for ride/event managers. This will allow them to input ride information and updates, including sources/links to their existing websites, pages, blogs, Facebook pages, or other social media pages.

### Features
The data-entry portal will include the following features:

*   **Ride Information Input:** A form to input all relevant ride details (e.g., date, location, distances, requirements, contact info).
*   **Link Management:** The ability to add multiple links to existing websites, pages, blogs, Facebook pages, or other social media pages.
*   **Update/Notification Management:** A system to create and manage updates, notifications, and notices related to a specific event.
*   **User Subscription Management:** (Potentially) A way to manage user subscriptions to event updates.

### Technology
The data-entry portal will be a separate web application, potentially built using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js. It will connect to the same database as the mobile app.

### Access Control
Access to the data-entry portal will be restricted to authorized ride/event managers. A secure authentication system will be implemented to verify their identity.
