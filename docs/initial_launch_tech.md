# TrailBlaze App - Initial Launch Technical Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical architecture and technology stack for the initial launch of the TrailBlaze application. The focus is on delivering a cross-platform mobile app with key features for endurance and trail riders, initially targeting the PNER (Pacific Northwest Endurance Rides) region.

## 2. Goals

*   Develop a cross-platform mobile app for iOS and Android.
*   Provide a centralized event calendar, detailed ride information, trip planning, and an AI-powered Q&A assistant.
*   Ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.
*   Enable easy maintenance and future scalability.

## 3. Technology Stack

### 3.1. Mobile App (Frontend)

*   **Framework:** Flutter
    *   Flutter allows for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Its performance and rich set of UI widgets make it ideal for creating a smooth and consistent user experience across platforms.
*   **Language:** Dart
*   **Local Data Storage:** SQLite (via `sqflite` Flutter package)
    *   SQLite is a lightweight, embedded database that will store event data, user preferences, and cached information locally on the device. This enables offline access and reduces the need for constant API calls.

### 3.2. Backend Service (API)

*   **Language:** Python
    *   Python is chosen for its ease of development, extensive libraries, and strong community support. It is well-suited for building the API and handling data processing tasks.
*   **Framework:** FastAPI
    *   FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+. It offers automatic data validation, serialization, and API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
    *   PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database that will store event data, user information, and other persistent data.
*   **AI Integration:** Gemini API (Google AI)
    *   The AI-powered Q&A assistant will be integrated into the backend service using the Gemini API. This allows the backend to handle natural language queries and provide relevant answers based on event data and general knowledge.

### 3.3. Data Scraping Service

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Libraries:** Scrapy, Beautiful Soup
    *   These libraries will be used to scrape event data from various sources, such as PNER website, ride managers' websites, and Facebook pages.

### 3.4. Infrastructure

*   **Cloud Provider:** TBD (Azure, AWS, or GCP)
*   **API Hosting:** Serverless functions (e.g., Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) or a containerized application (e.g., Docker) deployed on a cloud platform.
*   **Database Hosting:** Cloud-managed PostgreSQL service (e.g., Azure Database for PostgreSQL, AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL).

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1. Overview

The TrailBlaze app follows a three-tier architecture:

1.  **Mobile App (Frontend):** Handles user interaction, displays data, and communicates with the backend API.
2.  **Backend Service (API):** Processes requests from the mobile app, retrieves data from the database, integrates with the AI service, and returns responses to the mobile app.
3.  **Data Scraping Service:** Collects event data from various sources and populates the database.

### 4.2. Data Flow

1.  The user interacts with the mobile app (e.g., browsing events, asking a question).
2.  The mobile app sends a request to the backend API.
3.  The backend API processes the request:
    *   Retrieves data from the PostgreSQL database.
    *   If the request involves the AI assistant, it sends a query to the Gemini API.
4.  The backend API returns a response to the mobile app.
5.  The mobile app displays the data to the user.
6.  The data scraping service periodically collects event data from various sources and updates the PostgreSQL database.

### 4.3. AI Integration

The AI-powered Q&A assistant is integrated into the backend service as follows:

1.  The mobile app sends a question to the backend API.
2.  The backend API receives the question and retrieves relevant context from the database (e.g., event details).
3.  The backend API sends the question and context to the Gemini API.
4.  The Gemini API processes the question and returns an answer.
5.  The backend API returns the answer to the mobile app.
6.  The mobile app displays the answer to the user.

## 5. Development Process

1.  **Phase 1: Setup and Core Functionality**
    *   Set up the Flutter project and implement basic UI components.
    *   Set up the PostgreSQL database and define the data model.
    *   Develop the backend API endpoints for retrieving event data.
    *   Implement the data scraping service to collect event data.
2.  **Phase 2: AI Integration**
    *   Integrate the Gemini API into the backend service.
    *   Implement the Q&A interface in the mobile app.
    *   Test and fine-tune the AI assistant.
3.  **Phase 3: Testing and Refinement**
    *   Conduct thorough testing of all features.
    *   Refine the UI and improve the user experience.
    *   Optimize performance and ensure scalability.
4.  **Phase 4: Deployment and Launch**
    *   Deploy the backend API and database to the cloud.
    *   Publish the mobile app to the App Store and Google Play Store.
    *   Monitor the app and address any issues.

## 6. Conclusion

This technical overview provides a solid foundation for the initial launch of the TrailBlaze application. By leveraging Flutter, Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and the Gemini API, we can deliver a high-quality, cross-platform mobile app that meets the needs of endurance and trail riders.
